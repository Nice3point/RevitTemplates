## Fork, Clone, Branch and Create your PR

Once you've discussed your proposed feature/fix/etc. with a team member, and you've agreed an approach or a spec has been written and approved, it's time to start development:

1. Fork the repo if you haven't already
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create & push a feature branch
4. Create a [Draft Pull Request (PR)](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
5. Work on your changes

## Rules

- Follow the pattern of what you already see in the code.
- When adding new classes/methods/changing existing code: check the functionality of the templates by creating a new project based on them.

## Naming of features and functionality

The naming should be descriptive and direct, giving a clear idea of the functionality and usefulness in the future.
